# How to Set Up Your Memory Game GitHub Repository

Follow these steps to download the files and create a GitHub repository:

## Step 1: Download the Files

Save each of the files created above:

1. `index.html` - Main HTML file
2. `styles.css` - CSS stylesheet
3. Create a `scripts` folder and save `game.js` inside it
4. Create an `assets/images` folder structure and save `card-back.svg` inside it
5. `README.md` - Project documentation
6. `LICENSE` - MIT license
7. `.gitignore` - Git ignore file

## Step 2: Set Up Local Repository

Open your terminal/command prompt and navigate to the folder where you saved the files:

```bash
cd path/to/memory-game
```

Initialize a Git repository:

```bash
git init
```

Add all files to the repository:

```bash
git add .
```

Commit the files:

```bash
git commit -m "Initial commit: Memory Game"
```

## Step 3: Create GitHub Repository

1. Go to [GitHub](https://github.com) and sign in
2. Click on the "+" icon in the top right and select "New repository"
3. Name your repository (e.g., "memory-game")
4. Add a description (optional)
5. Choose whether to make it public or private
6. Do NOT initialize with a README, .gitignore, or license (since we already have these files)
7. Click "Create repository"

## Step 4: Connect and Push to GitHub

GitHub will show you commands to connect your local repository. Use the "push an existing repository" option:

```bash
git remote add origin https://github.com/yourusername/memory-game.git
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

Replace `yourusername` with your actual GitHub username.

## Step 5: Verify

Visit `https://github.com/yourusername/memory-game` to ensure all files were uploaded correctly.
